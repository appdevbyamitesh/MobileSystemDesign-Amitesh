### **Day 10: Final Revision & Behavioral Prep**

#### Morning (2 hours): Quick Revision

**Concurrency Cheat Sheet**
```swift
// GCD
DispatchQueue.main.async { }
DispatchQueue.global(qos: .userInitiated).async { }

// async/await
Task {
    let result = try await fetchData()
}

// Actors
actor DataStore {
    private var data: [String: Any] = [:]
    func set(_ value: Any, forKey key: String) {
        data[key] = value
    }
}

// Common patterns
- Serial queue for thread-safety
- Barriers for read-write locks
- DispatchGroup for coordination
- Semaphores for resource limiting
```

**Memory Management Cheat Sheet**
```swift
// Strong (default)
var object = MyClass()

// Weak (optional, becomes nil)
weak var delegate: MyDelegate?

// Unowned (non-optional, crashes if nil)
unowned let parent: Parent

// Capture lists in closures
{ [weak self] in
    self?.doSomething()
}

// Common retain cycles
- Closures capturing self
- Delegates (use weak)
- Timer targets (use weak)
```

**Design Patterns Cheat Sheet**
```swift
// Singleton
class Manager {
    static let shared = Manager()
    private init() {}
}

// Factory
protocol Vehicle { }
class VehicleFactory {
    static func make(type: VehicleType) -> Vehicle { }
}

// Observer
NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(...)

// Builder
class RequestBuilder {
    func setURL(_ url: URL) -> Self { }
    func setMethod(_ method: HTTPMethod) -> Self { }
    func build() -> URLRequest { }
}
```
